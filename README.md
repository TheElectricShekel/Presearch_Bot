# Presearch_Bot
Presearch_Bot will automatically make 40 searches using search terms randomly selected from the 7000 most popular questions searched on Google.  Each search will grant you 0.10 - 0.13 PRE tokens for the first 32 searches you make per day.  When you reach a balance of 1000 PRE tokens, you can withdraw them to a wallet that accepts EC20 tokens (like MetaMask).
